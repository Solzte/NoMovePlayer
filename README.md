# NoMovePlayer
Restrict Fishing Rod and Wind Charge Usage üå¨Ô∏è

## Overview
NoMovePlayer is a Minecraft plugin designed to enhance your server's gameplay by restricting certain interactions. Specifically, it prevents players from using the fishing rod to catch living entities and restricts the use of Wind Charge. The plugin is aimed at creating a more controlled and balanced experience, especially when it comes to using these specific items.

## Features
Fishing Rod Restrictions: Prevents players from catching living entities using fishing rods.
Wind Charge Restrictions: Disables any interaction with Wind Charge items for all players, preventing usage server-wide.
Paper Support: This plugin has been tested and works with Minecraft Paper version 1.21.1.

## How It Works
Fishing Rod Restriction: When players attempt to catch a living entity using a fishing rod, the action is immediately cancelled, and they are notified with a custom message.
Wind Charge Restriction: If any player attempts to use the Wind Charge item, the usage is blocked entirely.
Version: This plugin is specifically designed and tested for Paper version 1.21.1 for the best compatibility.
